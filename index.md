Hi! I'm Tanush, a student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. This page contains a portfolio required by the Interdisciplinary Honors program.

## Artifact: My First Midterm

Getting this midterm back was a big shock. I had spent a lot of time studying for the test, and I also remembered leaving the exam feeling that I had did well. Technically speaking, I didn't even do that bad, but with the curve my grade was down to a 2.7. In high school, I would have freaked out if I had gotten such a low grade, but here I was only sad about it for maybe an hour or so before I was like "OK time to move on and figure out what I can do better next time." I'm pretty happy with that mindset, and I think it's mostly possible because I've heard that your GPA isn't super important in computer science. I reached out to some classmates that did well on the midterm and learned from their study strategies. For the next midterm, I spent a lot more time doing practice midterms instead of simply reviewing the topics. I also did my notesheet differently, focusing on how to approach problems as opposed to taking notes on the theorems. My next midterm went pretty good, I haven't gotten the grade back yet but I was definetly much more confident.
